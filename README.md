## Overview
This project provides an interactive platform to explore global temperature changes over the past 120 years (1901–2020). It is designed to help users analyze temperature anomalies, long-term trends, and seasonal and regional variations through intuitive and dynamic visualizations.

## Features

### 🌟 Why This Project Matters
- Comprehensive Insights: Understand global temperature trends over the past century, shedding light on climate patterns.
- Anomalies and Trends: Highlight seasonal and regional variations to uncover anomalies and significant long-term trends.
- Informed Awareness: Support research and increase awareness of climate change through an accessible and educational interface.

### 🛠️ How It Works
- Focused Visualizations: Clean, minimalistic maps with color-coded temperature ranges for an impactful representation.
- Comparative Analysis: Side-by-side spatial and temporal trend views for effortless comparisons.
- Multi-Dimensional Insights: Combines maps, radial plots, and line charts to offer a multi-faceted perspective.
- Seasonal Exploration: Faceted breakdown of monthly and yearly trends to emphasize seasonal variations.
- Customizable Filters: Dynamic filters for country, year, and month allow users to explore data relevant to their interests.

## Tools & Technologies 🛠️
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- D3.js and multiple D3.js libraries such as:
  - Choropleth Maps: For spatial representation of data.
  - Anomaly Visualizations: To highlight deviations from the norm.
  - Polar Charts: To explore data seasonally.
